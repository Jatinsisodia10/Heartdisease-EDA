**Project Summary**: Data Visualization on Heart Disease Dataset
**Project Activities**:

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart disease dataset using various visualization techniques:
- Created distribution plots (DistPlot) to analyze the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- Used pie charts to examine the distribution of categorical variables related to heart disease.
- Employed violin plots to compare the distribution of numerical variables across different categories.
- Generated a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
- Constructed pair plots to identify relationships between multiple variables.
- Developed joint plots to explore the correlation and distribution between pairs of variables.
**Conclusion:**
The visualizations provided comprehensive insights into the heart disease dataset, revealing key patterns and relationships. For instance, the distribution of age showed a concentration in middle-aged individuals, categorical variables highlighted the prevalence of heart disease across different groups, and correlation analysis identified significant relationships between variables like age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease presence. These findings underscore the importance of targeted health interventions for specific demographics and the potential predictive power of certain variables in diagnosing heart disease.
